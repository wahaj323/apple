            purchase an Eligible Product at a Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may vary
            by Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to
            availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the
            Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart,
            including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for
            Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a
            0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount equal
            to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This will result in one ACMI
            installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI
            installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged
            over the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible
            Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple Gift Card in the amount
            of the applicable discount off the Eligible Product. Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR
            payment option that is only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products
            purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is
            subject to credit approval and credit limit. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about
            eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an
            Apple Card on and or after August 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24%
            to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See your Customer
            Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with
            Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR.
            Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an iPhone
            with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check
            out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not
            available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan;
            participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and
            Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each
            product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI
            financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term
            lengths and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about upcoming changes to
